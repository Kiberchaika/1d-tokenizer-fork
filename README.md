We present a compact 1D tokenizer which can represent an image with as few as 32 discrete tokens. As a result, it leads to a substantial speed-up on the sampling process (e.g., **410 Ã— faster** than DiT-XL/2) while obtaining a competitive generation quality.

## ðŸš€ Contributions

#### We introduce a novel 1D image tokenization framework that breaks grid constraints existing in 2D tokenization methods, leading to a much more flexible and compact image latent representation.

#### The proposed 1D tokenizer can tokenize a 256 Ã— 256 image into as few as 32 discrete tokens, leading to a signigicant speed-up (hundreds times faster than diffusion models) in generation process, while maintaining state-of-the-art generation quality.

#### We conduct a series of experiments to probe the properties of rarely studied 1D image tokenization, paving the path towards compact latent space for efficient and effective image representation.

## Installation
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get Started

We provide a [jupyter notebook](demo.ipynb) for a quick tutorial on reconstructing and generating images with TiTok-L-32.

We also support TiTok with [HuggingFace ðŸ¤— Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fun-research/TiTok)!
